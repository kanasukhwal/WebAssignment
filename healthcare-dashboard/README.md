Overview
This is a React project (using Vite for fast development) that implements a healthcare dashboard UI. It uses JavaScript/JSX (not TypeScript, despite the template), and leverages React Icons and some custom CSS for styling.

Main Features
Dashboard Layout:
The main layout is split into a sidebar, a header, and a main content area (src/App.jsx).
Sidebar:
Navigation links with icons for Dashboard, History, Calendar, Appointments, etc. (src/components/Sidebar.jsx)

Header:
Contains the app title, search bar, user info, and action buttons (src/components/Header.jsx).
Dashboard Main Content:
Health Data Cards: Show health status for Lungs, Teeth, Bone, etc.
Activity Feed: Simple bar chart showing weekly activity (src/components/ActivityFeed.jsx).
Calendar View: Visual calendar with appointment slots (src/components/CalendarView.jsx).
Upcoming Schedule: List of upcoming appointments (src/components/UpcomingSchedule.jsx).

Data
Appointments and Schedules:
Static data for appointments and schedules is stored in src/data/appointments.js and src/data/schedule.js.
Health Status:
Static health status data in src/data/healthStatus.js.
Styling
Uses both Tailwind CSS utility classes (in JSX) and custom CSS files (src/App.css, src/index.css).

Some components use inline styles for layout and 
colors.


Tooling
Vite for development/build (vite.config.ts).
ESLint for linting (eslint.config.js).
React Icons for iconography.
No backendâ€”all data is static and local.

How it Works
App Entry:
The app starts at src/main.tsx, rendering the App component.
App Layout:
App renders the Header, Sidebar, and DashboardMainContent.
Dashboard Content:
DashboardMainContent displays health cards, activity, calendar, and upcoming appointments using data from the /data folder.
